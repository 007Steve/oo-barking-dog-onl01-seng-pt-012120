# Barking Dog

## Description

In this lab, you'll be creating a Dog class. Every instance of a Dog should have
a name and be able to bark. In other words, I should be able to do:

```ruby
fido = Dog.new
fido.name = "Fido"

fido.name
# => "Fido"

fido.bark
# => "woof!"
```

## Instructions

Run the test suite to get started. You'll be writing all your code in the `lib/dog.rb` file.

Write a "Dog" class in dog.rb that makes the tests pass!
